 Forms a series with Tremolite and Ferro-actinolite. 
 
 Original spectrum published in: 
 
 Hunt, G.R., J.W. Salisbury, 1970, Visible and near-infrared 
 spectra of minerals and rocks: I. Silicate minerals.  Modern 
 Geology, vol. 1, pp283-300. 
 
 With the note: "The flattening of the spectral curve of the finest 
 size range near 2   umm, which produces a cross-over of the spectra, 
 is apparently due to a very slight contamination of the sample by 
 opaque inclusions of pyrite (?)." 
 
 A spectrum of this sample is also published in:

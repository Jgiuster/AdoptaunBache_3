 "40 kV - 30 mA, 6.5-9.5 keV 
  References: Bailey (1984, p. 574), Huebner's reference patterns 
  Found: dioctahedral mica, 2M1 polytype 
  Sought but not found: quartz, (100) would be distinct if present 
  Comments: Very similar patterns.  Only mica detected.  The mica 
            (004) reflection is at 17.6-17.9\(de2  uh , indicating a 
            large alkali such as potassium (the dioctahedral Na-mica, 
            paragonite, has the (004) reflection at 18.4\(de). The small 
            sample size required smear mounts, which are responsible for 
            a strong preferred basal orientation in each of the patterns. 
            I'd be surprised if you found any differences in the optical 
            spectra of these eight micas."

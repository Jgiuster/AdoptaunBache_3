  Reference: JCPDS #22-827 (jarosite) 
  Found: Jarosite 
  Comment: Sharp patterns (GDS99 is exceptional) indicate good 
           crystallinity and compositional homogeneity.  All 
           reflections are accounted for by the JCPDS card. 
           However, the samples are not identical.  GDS98 has 
           cell hexagonal dimensions a = 7.313(1) and c = 17.060(4) 
           angstroms whereas GDS99 has a = 7.302(1) and c = 17.214(2) 
           angstroms.  The difference in c is significant and suggests 
           a composition difference between the two samples.  Are 
           there differences in the optical spectra?"

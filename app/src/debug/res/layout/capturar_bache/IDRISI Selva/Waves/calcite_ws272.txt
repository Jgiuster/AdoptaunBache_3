 SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION: 
 
 .fi 
 Forms series with Rhodochrosite.  Trimorphous with Aragonite and 
 Vaterite. 
 
 This sample was ground from a beautiful single crystal of type 
 Iceland Spar.  The single crystal appeared pure, and the visible-NIR 
 spectrum appears pure.

 Pure sample from single crystal.  Rhommbic cleavage, twins, uniaxial, 
 very high birefringence, fizzes readily in dilute HCl.  Smaller grains 
 adhere to larger grains covering 40-80% of larger grains cleavage surfaces.

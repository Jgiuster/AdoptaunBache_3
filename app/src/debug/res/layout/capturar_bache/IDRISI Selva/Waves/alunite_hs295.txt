 and near-infrared spectra of minerals and rocks:  IV.

 With the following comment: "Alunite is white when pure ... This particular 
 sample is pink, presumably because of a small amount of iron which 
 causes the fall-off in reflectivity toward the blue.  No iron bands 
 are seen in the near-infrared ..."

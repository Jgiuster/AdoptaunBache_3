 Comment: there are weak bands at 1.4 and 1.55   umm.  The 1.55 might 
 be due to alunite.  If so, the buddingtonite feature is more than 10 
 times stronger, so the buddingtonite 2.1-  umm feature is probably 
 spectrally pure.  Similar arguments for the 1.4 band.  If these 
 features are due to buddingtonite itself, then it is even more 
 spectrally pure.  Roger N. Clark

 Buddingtonite has mottled extinction and is highly altered.  Quartz forms large
 r grains. 
 Most buddingtonite is polygranular with effective grain size around 40   umm.

 "40 kV - 30 mA, 7.2-9.5 keV 
  References: Bailey (1984, p. 574), Huebner's reference patterns 
  Found: dioctahedral mica, 2M1 polytype 
  Sought but not found: quartz, (100) would be distinct if present 
  Comments: Very similar patterns.  Only mica detected.  The mica (004) 
            reflection is at 17.6-17.9\(de2  uh , indicating a large alkali 
  	   such as potassium (the dioctahedral Na-mica, paragonite, 
            has the (004) reflection at 18.4\(de). The small sample size 
            required smear mounts, which are responsible for a strong 
            preferred basal orientation in each of the patterns.  I'd be 
            surprised if you found any differences in the optical spectra 
            of these eight micas."
